# Bouncing Ball Game

A simple yet fun bouncing ball game built with Python and Pygame. Control a paddle to keep the ball in play, score points, and watch as the background color dynamically changes with every successful bounce!

# Features
- Dynamic Gradient Background: The background color smoothly changes every time the ball bounces off the paddle or walls.
- Paddle Control: Use the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right.
- Randomized Ball Direction: The ball launches in a random direction after the initial key press.
- Score Counter: Score increases with every successful bounce off the paddle.

# Gameplay
1. Run the game, and a ball will rest on the paddle.
2. Press any key to launch the ball in a random direction.
3. Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to control the paddle and keep the ball from falling.
4. Every time the ball hits the paddle or the screen boundaries, the background changes color.
5. The game ends if the ball falls below the screen. Your score is then displayed in the console.
